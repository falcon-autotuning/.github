# FAlCon — Autotuning for Quantum-Dot Qubits ⚛️🚀

TL;DR — FAlCon is a community-driven ecosystem building the tools that help labs get quantum-dot devices back into operation faster and more reproducibly. 
This org is actively under development: repos, demos, and example flows are coming online. Welcome — you’ve found the project's front door.

Why this org exists
- Experiments take too long to recover after maintenance and cooldowns. FAlCon makes the recovery and tuning steps repeatable and sharable across labs.
- We build instrument adapters, measurement logging, simulation harnesses, reusable autotuning algorithms, and user-facing tooling that together span the full measurement stack.
- This is the org-level entry: think of this README as the map and invitation to join a community shaping the toolkit.

This is a work in progress
- Many codebases and a canonical demo are in active development and will appear here as repos come online.
- Instead of waiting for a finished demo, we want to onboard contributors now — documentation, designs, tests, small utilities, and simulations are high-impact ways to help today.

Who should read this
- Experimentalists: want robust routines to speed up bring-up and calibration
- Software engineers: want to build lab automation and instrumentation tooling
- Students & newcomers: want hands-on, reproducible ways to learn device tuning
- Designers & front-end devs: help make monitoring and control intuitive

Explore (what will live here)
- Core primitives: device models, tuning primitives, simulation harness
- Instrument adapters: lab-grade drivers and simulated backends
- Algorithms & flows: search, fit, state-detection, flow orchestration
- UI & visualization: monitoring, dashboards, and manual override interfaces
- Docs & examples: tutorials, HOWTOs, and onboarding materials

How you can help today (no demo required)
- Improve or write docs: onboarding pages, architecture overviews, and HOWTOs are the fastest way to help.
- Curate & triage issues: help label, categorize, and prioritize repo issues so newcomers can find good-first tasks.
- Write small tests & reproducible examples: simulation harness tests let reviewers validate algorithm changes without hardware.
- Contribute templates: help us by adding CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, ISSUE and PR templates.
- Design assets & UX ideas: draft wireframes or mockups for the dashboard and monitoring pages.
- Community building: add short “Welcome” notes, a FAQ, or triage backlog items.

Quick orientation for a newcomer
1. Read the top-level docs in /docs (or the repo READMEs once available).
2. Look for issues labeled good-first-issue or help-wanted in the repos list below.
3. Start with documentation, tests, or a small utility — no cryostat needed.
4. Open a Discussion or Issue titled "onboarding: <what-you-want>" if you want a mentor or pairing.

Repository conventions & signals
- Branches: main = stable; dev/* for new work
- Helpful labels: good-first-issue, help-wanted, docs, simulation, adapter, algo, ux

Governance & community norms
- Lightweight maintainer model by repository. PR reviews and tests are required for code merges.
- Please follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/falcon-autotuning/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Security or sensitive issues: report privately to the maintainers listed in SECURITY.md (add when available).

Licenses
- Components use MPL and BSD-3-Clause; check each repository's LICENSE file for specifics.
